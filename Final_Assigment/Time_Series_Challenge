The crypto realm had quite some ups and downs. Biggest guys on the block experienced several forks: Bitcoin (BTC) 'parented' BitcoinGold (BTG) and BitcoinCash (BCH); Ethereum (ETH) has to co-exist with EthereumClassic (ETC), EthereumFog (ETF), EthereumZero (ETZ) and EtherInc (ETI). How strong is a connection between the initial and the forked crypto? Can it be used for trading? There are many opinions, you can form your own.

You are provided with time series of these 8 cryptos (price, volume and market capitalization) from April 2013 to nowadays. Your goal is to make a two-weeks ahead prediction for the trading volume of the above-mentioned 8 cryptos. For that purpose you can use any sort of RNN and possibly other NN architectures (if needed). Make sure you provide a classic statistical forecasting model (like ARIMA) as a benchmark.

IMPORTANT:

The predictions are made for the two weeks before the launch of this competitions, so you surely could try to look around for the numbers. But firstly - different resources might provide you with different numbers, secondly - it would probably be visible if you get too good all of a sudden and lastly - we do believe in your integrity.
Keep in mind that some cryptos are older, some are younger, so the length of corresponding time series is different.
Be attentive to the specific submission format - you can check it in the sample submission.
You can not use the data outside of what was provided.
In order to qualify for evaluation, enter a one-person team and change the name to your matriculation number.
Prediction evaluation for the final project in ADAMS SS19 at Humboldt-University.
